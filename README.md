### Detection Methods:
- **General Testing Methods:** Place the device against the testing object, wait for 60 seconds (4 cycles), and ensure the readings stabilize. For marble radiation testing, the recommended testing time is 5 minutes; check the average values afterward.
- **Iodine-131 Test:** Place the device near the patient’s affected area. Wait about 1 minute and check the real-time value.
- **Ambient Radiation Test:** Place the device 1 meter above the ground, avoiding beta radiation from the ground. Conduct testing in open spaces for 5 minutes and observe the average readings on the display.
- **Radiation Source Search:** Switch the display to the histogram interface and scan the object near the back of the device. Observe the graphical display and listen for alarm sounds.
- **DR/X-ray Leakage Test:** Observe the device's instant readings when exposed to radiation.

### National Standard Radiation Thresholds:
- **>0.5 μSv/h:** Exceeds average level, note the scenario

#### Radiation Levels:
- **Natural ambient radiation level:** 0.1~0.20 μSv/h (normal background level)
- **Indoor radiation level:** 0.25 μSv/h (closed room radiation level)
- **Marble and ceramic tile radiation level:** 0.30~0.40 μSv/h (possible levels from construction materials)
- **National standard radiation alarm level:** 0.50 μSv/h (alarm level; protective measures may be required above this level)
- **Airplane radiation level:** 2-3 μSv/h (radiation level during flights, reducing flight frequency recommended)
- **Vintage camera lens radiation level:** <20 μSv/h (vintage lenses may contain trace radiation-emitting materials; handle with care)
- **Small ore radiation level:** 40+ μSv/h (ore, avoid contact)
- **Energy stone radiation level:** 100 μSv/h (some energy stones, maintain distance)
- **Medical treatment radiation level:** 100+ μSv/h (follow medical advice for specific procedures)
- **X-ray machine internal radiation level:** 2000+ μSv/h (instantaneous value, restricted area)
- **CT scan radiation level:** 9999+ μSv/h (several dozen mSv; follow medical advice, only when necessary)

### Warranty:
18-month official warranty.

### Additional Features:
- Users can install and replace preferred Geiger-Müller counters, including J321, J305, M4011, SBM20, RD003, and others.
- Press and hold both the up and down buttons simultaneously to enter the advanced settings page, where you can configure the calibration coefficient (Cf), sensor probe model, Geiger counter voltage, and more.

### Description of Features:
- When off, the LED blinks, indicating charging.
- When off, the LED is steady, indicating a full charge.
- The **Contact** and **Exp.Time** functions are exclusive to the KB6011® series. They can record the number and duration of exposures. For example, during a CT scan, the device records two continuous exposures, each lasting 6 seconds, for a total of 12 seconds. All data is logged, assisting doctors in evaluating radiation harm.

### Detection Methods:
- **General Testing Methods:** Place the device against the testing object, wait for 60 seconds (4 cycles), and ensure the readings stabilize. For marble radiation testing, the recommended testing time is 5 minutes; check the average values afterward.
- **Iodine-131 Test:** Place the device near the patient’s affected area. Wait about 1 minute and check the real-time value.
- **Ambient Radiation Test:** Place the device 1 meter above the ground, avoiding beta radiation from the ground. Conduct testing in open spaces for 5 minutes and observe the average readings on the display.
- **Radiation Source Search:** Switch the display to the histogram interface and scan the object near the back of the device. Observe the graphical display and listen for alarm sounds.
- **DR/X-ray Leakage Test:** Observe the device's instant readings when exposed to radiation.
